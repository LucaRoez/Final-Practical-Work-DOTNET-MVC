# Final Practical Work DOTNET MVC

### This is my final work for the institution called Polo Tecnológico from Mina Clavero, a educational institution subsidized by several companies included the Argentine State. All inside the country :argentina:
##### The process took two years and had two learning stages. I've also learned other technologies and techniques led by other online programming courses. Because of this, I'll detached the technologies used in this project into these two classifications according to my apprenticeship source.
