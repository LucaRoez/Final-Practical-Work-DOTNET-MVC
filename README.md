# Final-Practical-Work-DOTNET-MVC
This is my final practical work for the C# .NET MVC course for the Polo Tecnológico from Mina Clavero, in Córdoba; Argentina, where I learned C# technologies like Entity Framework or Razor, and DotNet environment, using MVC architecture. But also what I've been learning since then, like HTML, CSS and JS, among others.
